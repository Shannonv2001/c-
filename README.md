# Write program that gets the following information from the user:  The subtotal of the restaurant bill The sales tax rate The desired tip rate The number of people in the party The program will then calculate the grand total and divide it by the number of people to let each person know what they owe on the bill. It will use the formula: 1 patron’s payment = (subtotal + subtotal * tax rate + subtotal * tip rate) / number of patrons Equivalently, this can be written as: 1 patron’s payment = (subtotal * (1 + tax rate + tip rate)) / number of patrons  Make sure to round up in the final answer to the nearest cent.
